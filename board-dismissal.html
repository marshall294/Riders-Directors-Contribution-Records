  <h1>BOARD MEMBER DISMISSAL POLICY</h1>
  <p>Riders Football Club</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <div class="note">
    This policy outlines the correct, fair, and transparent procedure for dismissing a Board Member of Riders FC.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Purpose of This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure dismissals are not based on personal conflict, bias, or emotion, Riders FC establishes a clear and fair framework for removing a Board Member when necessary.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Grounds for Dismissal</h2>
  <p>A Board Member may be dismissed for any of the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Financial Misconduct</strong> — Misappropriation, diversion, or misuse of club funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Gross Misconduct</strong> — Acts that tarnish the image of Riders FC, including assault, fraud, or unethical behaviour.</li>
    <li><strong>Neglect of Duties</strong> — Failure to perform assigned responsibilities over an extended period.</li>
    <li><strong>Absenteeism</strong> — Missing three (3) consecutive official meetings without valid reason.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong> — Acting in ways that benefit personal interest over the club’s interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Insubordination</strong> — Refusal to follow club rules, constitutional provisions, or official directives.</li>
    <li><strong>Criminal Conviction</strong> — Being found guilty of a criminal offence by a competent court.</li>
    <li><strong>Violation of the Club Constitution</strong> — Any serious breach of the constitution or official policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Complaint & Investigation Process</h2>
  <p>Dismissal must begin with a formal, documented process to prevent unfair treatment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A complaint must be submitted in writing to the Secretary or Chairman.</li>
    <li>The Executive Committee shall set up an <strong>Investigation Panel</strong> of 3–5 neutral members.</li>
    <li>The accused Board Member must be notified in writing and given the opportunity to defend themselves.</li>
    <li>The panel shall gather evidence, interview witnesses, and present a written report within 14 days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Fair Hearing</h2>
  <p>
    Before any dismissal decision, the Board Member has the right to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respond to all allegations.</li>
    <li>Provide witnesses or documents in their defence.</li>
    <li>Be heard before the General House or Executive Committee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Voting Process for Dismissal</h2>
  <p>Dismissal can only occur through a structured voting process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A General Meeting must be convened.</li>
    <li>Quorum: At least <strong>2/3 majority</strong> of registered members must be present.</li>
    <li>A minimum of <strong>2/3 majority vote</strong> from members present is required for dismissal.</li>
    <li>The vote may be done openly or through secret ballot depending on sensitivity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Immediate Suspension</h2>
  <p>
    In cases of serious misconduct, the Executive Committee may suspend the Board Member pending full investigation.
    Suspension is not equal to dismissal.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Post-Dismissal Actions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The dismissed member loses all rights, privileges, and entitlements of their office.</li>
    <li>They may only receive financial benefits earned before the dismissal date.</li>
    <li>They must return all club property (documents, funds, kits, identification etc.).</li>
    <li>A replacement may be appointed or elected following constitutional rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Appeals</h2>
  <p>
    The dismissed member may file an appeal within 14 days. The Appeals Committee shall review and either uphold or overturn the dismissal.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Protection Against Abuse of Power</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No member shall be dismissed based on personal issues, tribalism, discrimination, or bias.</li>
    <li>All decisions must align with the Club Constitution and Nigerian law.</li>
  </ul>
