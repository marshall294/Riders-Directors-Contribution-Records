  </header>

  <div class="container">

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Under no circumstance shall 100% of any income, transfer fee, or profit be shared. A mandatory portion must always be reserved for the official Riders FC Club Purse.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Purpose of This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This policy defines the rules for income sharing, player transfer benefits, profit distribution, and financial treatment of members who leave, join, or are removed from the club. The goal is fairness, transparency, and sustainability of the club.

      <li>Bonuses from player promotions, endorsements, or development fees.</li>
      <li>General club profit from major financial activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Mandatory Club Purse Reservation</h2>
    <p>
      For sustainability, Riders FC shall retain a fixed percentage of all revenues before any sharing occurs. This ensures the club continues to grow and operate effectively.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Club Purse Retention:</strong> Minimum of <strong>30%</strong> of every income or profit.</li>
      <li>This percentage may increase depending on financial needs but can never go below 30%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Player Transfer / Sign-Out Sharing Formula</h2>
    <p>When a player is signed out or transferred, income shall be shared as follows:</p>

      <li><strong>40% — Team Members</strong> (shared equally among all registered, active members)</li>
      <li><strong>20% — Technical Crew</strong> (Coach, assistants, fitness staff etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>10% — Development Bonus</strong> (reserved for scouting, youth setup, and future player development)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. General Profit Sharing</h2>
    <p>For profits not related to transfers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>30% — Club Purse</strong></li>
      <li><strong>50% — Entire Membership Body</strong> (equal distribution)</li>
      <li><strong>20% — Executive & Technical Operations</strong> (logistics, welfare, staff incentives)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. When a New Member Joins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New members are not eligible for any backdated profit or transfer benefits.</li>
      <li>Eligibility begins after <strong>3 months</strong> of active participation and dues compliance.</li>
      <li>They immediately contribute to the Club Purse through registration fees or dues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. When a Member Leaves the Club</h2>
    <p>When a member leaves voluntarily:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are entitled to share from any profits declared <strong>before the date of exit</strong>.</li>
      <li>They lose eligibility for all future income, transfers, or bonuses.</li>
      <li>No refund of dues, fees, or prior contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. In the Event of Member Death</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Next‑of‑kin receives any profit or entitlement the member had already earned before death.</li>
      <li>The club may provide optional support (financial or ceremonial) based on available resources.</li>
      <li>No future earnings or projections will be transferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. When a Member Is Excommunicated or Suspended</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All future financial rights are immediately void.</li>
      <li>They may only receive shares from profit or income declared before the sanction date.</li>
      <li>Severe misconduct may lead to forfeiture of all pending entitlements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Review and Amendment</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may be reviewed annually or amended by a 2/3 majority during a general meeting. All changes must uphold the rule that the club purse cannot be fully shared.
