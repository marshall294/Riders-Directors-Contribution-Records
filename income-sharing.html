    <h1>AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>1. Purpose of Amendments</h2>
    <p>
      The amendment process ensures that Riders Football Club remains progressive, adaptable, and responsive to emerging needs. Amendments allow the constitution to evolve in line with modern standards, club growth, legal requirements, and organisational reforms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Conditions for Amending the Constitution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An amendment may be proposed by any registered member of Riders FC.</li>
      <li>A formal written submission must be presented to the Secretary at least two weeks before the general meeting.</li>
      <li>Proposals must clearly state the section(s) to be amended and the reasons for such amendments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Approval Procedure</h2>
    <p>The constitution may be altered or amended only when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A general meeting is convened specifically to consider the amendment.</li>
      <li>A simple majority vote (50% + 1) of members present supports the amendment.</li>
      <li>All decisions must be documented and signed by the Secretary and Chairman.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Final Validation by CAC</h2>
    <p>
      After the club adopts any amendment internally, the updated constitution must be submitted to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) for review and approval. The amendment only becomes legally valid after CAC endorsement.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Emergency Amendments</h2>
    <p>
      In special or urgent circumstances affecting the operation or legality of the club, emergency amendments may be proposed and approved during an emergency general meeting, provided all members are given adequate notice.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Record Keeping</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All approved amendments must be entered into the official constitution document.</li>
      <li>The Secretary shall maintain both the original version and the updated amended version.</li>
      <li>Members must be notified within 7 days of any constitutional changes.</li>
    </ul>
